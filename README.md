## F.A.Q.

### Who are the creators of the Paraflex type system?
The Paraflex concept is brought into the world by its founders; M. Morgan J., D. Morgan (Flex Tech Design) and J. Vansickle (Paragon Concepts)

### Where does the name Paraflex come from?
The name is a double portmanteau, the word is created from two other words namely Para (Paragon Concepts) and Flex (Flex Tech Design) 

### What kind of system is a Paraflex?
Paraflex consists of two parallel [Quarter Wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudspeaker_enclosure#Quarter_wave_enclosure) Resonators ([Helmholtz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz_resonance)) which combine into one exit chamber (or mouth). There is a Low Tuned Resonator and a High Tuned Resonator (for short LTR and HTR). This makes a very efficient high output SPL cabinet. A positive side effect of combining the LTR and HTR is a high presure zone in front of the HTR chamber waht results in  better cone control of the driver used. A downside of the Paraflex is the requirement of drivers with high motor force (Bl). A Paraflex cabinet is usually a bit larger than other cabinet designs (there is no free lunch) because we need the HTR large enough for the resonator to take effect and also to allow the LTR to 'flow' into it.


### What is a Higher Order QuarterWave?
the 'Higher Order' simply describes a quarterwave cabinet with multiple resonators.

### Are there only Paraflex subwoofers?
No Paraflex is extended into mid-bass (kick-bins) and/or mid-range (tops) cabinet designs, either in single or double or even triple configurations all sharing the same design principle. 

## Practical information

### Are holes (round/triangle/etc) in braces required?
No, holes in braces are mostly for esthetic reasons or saving some weight on the cabinet. The loses over the bandwidth are non existing or very minimal

### Filling, stuffing, padding, wadding, damping what are these? 
Damping / padding is for damping resonances/vibrations in panels, reduce transmission or reflections of the cabinet panels, mostly bitumen or felt type layers that can be nailed/glued to panels on the inside of the cabinet.
Filling/wadding/stuffing are for 'fill' parts of the cabinet volume with fluffy polyfill type. Fopr example in the paraflex subs we use polyfill in the HTR at specific places to get rid of resonances at curtain frequencies.

### Do I need to round edges of the panels inside the subwoofer cabinet?
No, since the waves of the lower frequencies are so long (100hz = 3 meter) the waves will not see small bumbs, rounded edges etc.
