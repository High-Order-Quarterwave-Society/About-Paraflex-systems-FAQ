## F.A.Q.

### Who are the creators of the Paraflex type system?
The Paraflex concept waS first brought into the world by its founders; M. Morgan J., D. Morgan (Flex Tech Design) and J. Vansickle (Paragon Concepts)

### Where does the name Paraflex come from?
The name is a double portmanteau, the word is created from two other words namely Para (Paragon Concepts) and Flex (Flex Tech Design) 

### What kind of system is a Paraflex?
Paraflex consists of two parallel [Quarter Wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudspeaker_enclosure#Quarter_wave_enclosure) [Helmholtz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz_resonance) Resonators which combine into one exit chamber (or mouth). There is a Low Tuned Resonator and a High Tuned Resonator (for short LTR and HTR). Both resonators combine into one output. This makes a very efficient high output SPL cabinet. A positive side effect of the combineation is a higher presure zone in front or in the HTR zone which gives better cone control on the driver used. A downside of the Paraflex is the requirement of drivers with high motor force (Bl). A Paraflex cabinet us uselaly a bit larger than other cabinet designs (there is not free lucnch) because we need the HTR large enough for the resonator to take effect and also to allow the LTR to 'flow' into it.


### What is a Higher Order QuarterWave?
the 'Higher Order' simply discribes quarterwave cabinets which have multiple resonators

### Are there only Paraflex subwoofers?
No Paraflex is extended into mid-bass (kick-bins) and/or mid-range (tops) cabinet designs, either in single or double or even triple configurations all sharing the same design principle.
