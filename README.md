## FAQ


### Who are the creators of the Paraflex type system?
The Paraflex concept is the brainchild of its founders: M. Morgan J., D. Morgan (Flex Tech Design), and J. Vansickle (Paragon Concepts).

### Where does the name Paraflex come from?
The name Paraflex is a fusion of two words: "Para" from Paragon Concepts and "Flex" from Flex Tech Design.

### What kind of system is a Paraflex?
The Paraflex system is comprised of two parallel Quarter Wave Resonators that merge into a single exit chamber, known as the mouth. It consists of a Low Tuned Resonator (LTR) and a High Tuned Resonator (HTR), resulting in an efficient high-output SPL cabinet. The combination of LTR and HTR creates a high-pressure zone in front of the HTR chamber, enhancing cone control of the driver. Paraflex cabinets are typically slightly larger than other designs due to the need to tune both resonators and align their phases. However, once tuned, they deliver powerful and efficient performance.

### What is a Higher Order Quarter-Wave?
The term "Higher Order Quarter-Wave" describes a quarter-wave cabinet with multiple resonators.

### Are there only Paraflex subwoofers?
No, Paraflex extends beyond subwoofers to include mid-bass (kick-bins) and mid-range (tops) cabinet designs, available in single, double, or even triple configurations, all built on the same design principles.

## Practical Information

### Are braces required?
Yes, good and sufficient bracing is necessary, especially for subwoofer designs. Failure to brace the cabinet can result in reduced efficiency and a raised F-3 due to mechanical losses. Bracing prevents panel flexing and resonances while strengthening the enclosure, which is crucial as Paraflex subwoofer enclosures experience significant pressures.

### Are holes in braces required?
No, holes in non-blocking braces for Paraflex subwoofer designs are primarily for aesthetic purposes or weight reduction. The impact on losses over the bandwidth is minimal. Compensating for lost volume can be achieved by adding some inner height to the cabinet design. In mid and top designs, solid braces may have some effect since sound-wave lengths are shorter and may influence the sound.

### What is damping, stuffing, and padding used for?
Damping or padding is used to reduce resonances and vibrations in cabinet panels, minimizing transmission or reflections. This is typically achieved with bitumen or felt-type layers that can be affixed to the inside of the cabinet.

Filling, wadding, or stuffing involves adding fluffy polyfill to specific parts of the cabinet volume. For instance, in Paraflex subwoofers, polyfill is used in the LTR or HTR at specific locations to eliminate resonances at particular frequencies.

### What does the Helmholtz resonator do in Paraflex designs?
Helmholtz resonators are primarily used in mid-top design cabinets to tune or dampen specific frequencies, ensuring the cabinet's response is as flat as possible.

### Do I need to round the edges of the panels inside the subwoofer cabinet?
No, rounding the edges or making small alterations inside the subwoofer cabinet is unnecessary. Since lower frequencies have long waves (e.g., 100Hz = 3 meters), they won't be affected by small bumps or rounded edges.
