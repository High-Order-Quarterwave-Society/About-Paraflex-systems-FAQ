## FAQ

### Who are the creators of the Paraflex type system?
The Paraflex concept is brought into the world by its founders: M. Morgan J., D. Morgan (Flex Tech Design) and J. Vansickle (Paragon Concepts)

### Where does the name Paraflex come from?
The name is a combination of two words: "Para" from Paragon Concepts and "Flex" from Flex Tech Design.

### What kind of system is a Paraflex?
The Paraflex system consists of two parallel [Quarter Wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudspeaker_enclosure#Quarter_wave_enclosure) Resonators, which combine into one exit chamber (or mouth). It includes a Low Tuned Resonator (LTR) and a High Tuned Resonator (HTR), making it a very efficient high-output SPL cabinet. The combination of LTR and HTR results in a high-pressure zone in front of the HTR chamber, improving cone control of the driver used. However, the Paraflex requires drivers with high motor force (Bl). Due to the need to tune both resonators and align their phases, Paraflex cabinets are usually a bit larger than other designs. Nevertheless, once the tuning is complete, they exhibit a powerful and efficient synergy.


### What is a Higher Order Quarter-Wave?
The term "Higher Order Quarter-Wave" simply describes a quarterwave cabinet with multiple resonators.

### Are there only Paraflex subwoofers?
No, Paraflex extends to mid-bass (kick-bins) and/or mid-range (tops) cabinet designs, available in single, double, or even triple configurations—all sharing the same design principle.

## Practical information

## Braces, are they required?
Not bracing the cabinet results in reduced efficiency and raised F-3, due to mechanical losses. So yes good/enough bracing is required especaly on subwoofer designs. It prevents panel flexing/resonances and also strengthen the enclosure. The pressures in Paraflex subwoofer enclosure's are huge.

### Are holes (round/triangle/etc) in braces required?
No, holes, in non blocking, braces of Paraflex subwoofer designs are mostly for aesthetic reasons or to save weight. The losses over the bandwidth are non-existent or very minimal. However, we may lose some volume in the paths taken up by the braces. Compensation for the lost volume can be achieved by adding some inner height to the cabinet design. In mid and top designs solid braces may have some effect since the sound-wave lengths are shorter and may influence the sound.

### Filling, stuffing, padding, wadding, damping what are these? 
Damping/padding is for damping resonances/vibrations in panels, reducing transmission or reflections of the cabinet panels—usually accomplished with bitumen or felt type layers that can be nailed/glued to the inside of the cabinet.

Filling/wadding/stuffing involves 'filling' parts of the cabinet volume with fluffy polyfill types. For example, in Paraflex subwoofers, we use polyfill in the LTR or HTR at specific places to get rid of resonances at certain frequencies.

###What does the Helmhotz resonator do in the paraflex designs?
We primarily use Helmholtz resonators in mid-top design cabinets to tune frequencies, ensuring the cabinet's response is as flat as possible.

### Do I need to round edges of the panels inside the subwoofer cabinet?
No, since the waves of lower frequencies are so long (100Hz = 3 meters), they will not be affected by small bumps, rounded edges, etc.
